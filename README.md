## Description

The motivation behind the ideas and files was to create and manipulate the code presented in the starter code to increase the accessibility and flow of the website itself. By using the starter code as a base, and updating it and modifying it to change and make it according to the acceptance criteria, the changes made to it made it more accessible and presentable. Along with that the use of CSS would change, and the inclusion of semantic elements in the code, would better structure the code and make it presentable. The problem that its solves is that the website can stand as a standalone window into the service provided by the company. I learned that alot of solutions in code can be learned through breaking it down and selecting what you need to create the ideal user experience listed.
